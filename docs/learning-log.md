# Learning Log - M1A3 GitHub Repository Management

**Student:** Kayla Laken 
**Date:** Ovtober 26, 2025

## What I Learned
In this assignment, I learned:
- How to create a repository
- How to create a new file folder
- How workfolws create clear documentation

## Challenges and Solutions

- Understanding project workflows: Overcame by practicing and creating in GitHUb.
- Formating text: Overcame by practicing coding and working with the language.

## Connection to My GIS Career

GitHUb has provided me with additonal tools that will help assist me in future projects. Working with this coding platform has helped me better understand coding languages and how they are useful in GIS production.

## Open Source Workflow Understanding
Creating my own repository (`hello-gist604b`) mirrors the open source contribution process. In real projects, developers fork existing repositories, make improvements, and submit contributions - similar to how I created this repository and linked it to the assignment system.
